# Changelog
[[Format loosely based on <https://keepachangelog.com/en/0.3.0>]]

## On version numbers
The numbering scheme looks like `vXX_YY`:
  * "Major" version numbers (`XX`) represent major milestones (e.g.: first official release, big rework of machinery, etc.)
    `v00_YY` represent versions prior to the first official release.
  * "Minor" version numbers (`YY`) are incremented every time a release is tag.  They reset to `00` when the major number is incremented.
